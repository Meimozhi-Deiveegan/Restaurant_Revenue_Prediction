# Revenue Prediction Project Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details a project focused on predicting revenue based on the number of orders placed, using a dataset containing information about various restaurants. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and other relevant libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. We employ a Simple Linear Regression model to predict the revenue.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives were:

* To load and preprocess the restaurant revenue dataset.
* To train a Simple Linear Regression model to predict revenue based on the number of orders placed.
* To evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
* To visualize the model's predictions against the actual data.

## 3. Methodology

The project followed these steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:**
    * Imported necessary Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
    * Loaded the "revenue\_prediction.csv" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    * Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand the data's structure.
    * Checked for missing values.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Removed irrelevant columns: "Id," "Name," "Franchise," "Category," "City," and "No\_Of\_Item."
    * Created independent feature (x) and dependent variable (y) arrays.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.

3.  **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    * Trained a Simple Linear Regression model on the training set.
    * Predicted the revenue for the test set.
    * Visualized the training set results.
    * Visualized the testing set results.

## 4. Dataset Description

The "revenue\_prediction.csv" dataset contains the following columns:

* **Id:** Unique identifier for each restaurant.
* **Name:** Name of the restaurant.
* **Franchise:** Indicates whether the restaurant is a franchise.
* **Category:** Type of cuisine served by the restaurant.
* **City:** Location of the restaurant.
* **No\_Of\_Item:** Number of items on the restaurant's menu.
* **Order\_Placed:** Number of orders placed.
* **Revenue:** Revenue generated by the restaurant.

After preprocessing, the dataset was reduced to two columns:

* **Order\_Placed:** Independent variable.
* **Revenue:** Dependent variable.

## 5. Results and Observations

* The Simple Linear Regression model was successfully trained on the dataset.
* The model was used to predict revenue based on the number of orders placed.
* The visualization of the training and test set results showed a linear relationship between the number of orders placed and revenue.
* The model will predict the revenue based on the order placed, and the visualization makes it clear that the model is fitting the data well.

## 6. Conclusion

This project successfully trained and evaluated a Simple Linear Regression model for predicting restaurant revenue. The model's visualization indicates its effectiveness in representing the linear relationship between orders placed and revenue. The trained model can be used for forecasting revenue based on order counts.

## 7. Future Work

Future work on this project could include:

* Exploring other regression models, such as Polynomial Regression or Multiple Linear Regression, to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
* Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Simple Linear Regression model.
* Incorporating additional features or external data sources to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
* Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.
* Adding more data to improve the model accuracy.
* Performing feature engineering to create more relevant features.
* Adding more visualizations to gain deeper insights into the data.
